  Gnu parallel is indeed slick. I always try to align my data to make it possible to loop over it with a nice for loop added in a call to run the jobs in parallel then becomes super easy. I love the {1..99} syntax in bash.

  I used GNU Parallel to run a script locally that did what a big distributed system did, quicker and more reliably. It got to the point where people would just ask me to "run the thing" on my laptop instead of waiting for the cron.

  Using [GNU Parallel is] super easy if you use xargs, and it is magic for making things multi-process. Then adding in the ssh magic it can do it is an incredible tool that is completely underutilized.

  This is a fantastic tool, and I wish I had upgraded from xargs years ago!

  I have gotten a *ton* of mileage out of jq, awk, and GNU parallel,
  even at multi-GB sizes.
    -- Eric Wolak @ericthewolak@twitter 

GNU parallel, which works a little bit like xargs, but has a much more friendly way of handling files with spaces and automatically parallelises calls. This tool has saved me a great deal of coding because it makes it so easy to write a program which does just one part of a task and then run it in parallel with load balancing and a nice progress bar. I cannot recommend this tool enough.
